; PHP's initialization file, generally called php.ini, is responsible for
; configuring many of the aspects of PHP's behavior.
; For more information on the config file, please see:
; https://www.php.net/manual/en/index.php

; Maximum execution time of each script, in seconds
max_execution_time = 30

; Maximum amount of memory a script may consume
memory_limit = 256M

; Whether or not to display errors on the screen
display_errors = off

; Error reporting level
error_reporting = E_ALL & ~E_DEPRECATED & ~E_STRICT

; Default timezone
date.timezone = "Europe/London"

; Maximum amount of time each script may spend parsing request data. It's a good
; idea to limit this time on productions servers in order to eliminate unexpectedly
; long running scripts.
max_input_time = 60

; The display of errors which occur during PHP's startup sequence are handled
; separately from display_errors. Recommended set to 'off'
; for production servers to avoid leaking configuration details.
display_startup_errors = Off
